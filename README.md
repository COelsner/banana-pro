## GMediaRender

GMediaRender ([1](https://github.com/hzeller/gmrender-resurrect)) is a UPnP media renderer. Due to mutiple dependecies I made a small script for installing, which can be downloaded (by terminal) with the following command:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/COelsner/banana-pro/master/gmediarender/gmediarender-setup.sh`
